# Choose a License

If you don't choose a license your repository is under exclusive copyright by default and puts anyone looking to copy, distribute, or modify your work are at risk of take-downs, shake-downs, or litigation. Even if you're a good human and wouldn't think of taking legal action, others don't know that and may avoid your work because of the lack of clarity.

Even documentation such as this can be covered under licensing.

I chose the MIT License to keep things simple and permissive.
