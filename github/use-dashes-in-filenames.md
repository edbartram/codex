# Use Dashes in Filenames

Avoid:

* spaces - these get ugly real fast when they appear in a url, ex: avoid%20%20spaces.htm
* underscores - Google treats the underscore as a character so one_word is treated as one word, but two-words is searchable by either word
* camelCase - not good when mixing Windows and a Linux based OS
